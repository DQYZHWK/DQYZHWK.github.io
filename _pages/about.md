# üíº About Me

I am currently engaged in the training of GUI Agent models utilizing reinforcement learning and the application of Agents in GUI-interactive„ÄÅTool-interactive„ÄÅCode-inveractive„ÄÅHybrid-inveractive scenarios. I am scheduled to complete my master's degree in March 2026. If you have interests in multimodal understanding, multimodal agents, or online reinforcement learning, I am open to collaborations. Additionally, if you are recruiting researchers or algorithm engineers in these areas, please feel free to contact me at [dqyzhwk@gmail.com](mailto:dqyzhwk@gmail.com).

I obtained my bachelor's degree from Zhejiang A&F University and was an active participant in ACM competitions, reaching the EC-Final in 2020. Subsequently, I pursued my graduate studies at Zhejiang University. My academic advisor is [jingyuanchen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o_G2qa0AAAAJ), and I have independently conducted or collaborated on several research projects in visual generation and multimodal understanding, with <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6ykuTIYAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> on Google Scholar.
